"""
Journal metrics: win rate, avg win/loss, profit/loss ratio, and the
go/no-go bar from the automation plan's Phase 4 live-money gate
(see docs/Automation-Strategy-Backbone.md #5).

Reports "insufficient data" honestly when the trades table is empty or below
the minimum sample size, rather than fabricating a rate from zero trades.
Phase D (paper execution) is what populates the trades table this reads from.
