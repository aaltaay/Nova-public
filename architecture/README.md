# Nova architecture

Authoritative **target architecture** for the Pattern-Driven Architecture maintenance track (Phases 0–13).  
Baseline: [`baseline-phase0.md`](./baseline-phase0.md) · Product phases: [`docs/ROADMAP_STATUS.md`](../docs/ROADMAP_STATUS.md)

Constitution (`AGENTS.md` / `AGENTS.md`) and `.cursor/rules/*` remain supreme for trading gates, single-feed, and modularity. This folder records **how** we structure code toward those laws.

## Decisions (ADRs)

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [001](./decisions/001-modular-monolith.md) | Modular monolith (single FastAPI process) | Accepted |
| [002](./decisions/002-hexagonal-ports-adapters.md) | Selective hexagonal ports/adapters | Accepted |
| [003](./decisions/003-functional-core-imperative-shell.md) | Functional core / imperative shell | Accepted |
| [004](./decisions/004-strangler-facades.md) | Strangler facades + compatibility barrels | Accepted |
| [005](./decisions/005-frontend-feature-slices.md) | Frontend feature slices + workspace shell | Accepted |
| [006](./decisions/006-css-itcss-cascade-layers.md) | ITCSS-inspired CSS + native cascade layers | Accepted |
| [007](./decisions/007-centralized-trading-execution.md) | Centralized trading execution path | Accepted |
| [008](./decisions/008-persistent-ibkr-scanner-rosters.md) | Persistent IBKR scanner rosters | Accepted |

## Rules and maps

- [`dependency-rules.md`](./dependency-rules.md) — allowed/forbidden imports (enforced warning-first in Phase 1, then blocking for new violations).
- [`phase-destination-map.md`](./phase-destination-map.md) — Phase 1–13 module destinations vs layers/slices.

## What Nova will **not** adopt

- Microservices, message brokers, or distributed runtime state
- Framework-wide class/service wrappers that only rename existing calls
- Full-repository Feature-Sliced Design renaming in one pass
- Big-bang CSS Modules or mandatory Tailwind conversion
- A new global event bus for cross-feature chat

These are **references**, not templates to copy wholesale. Nova's single-process IBKR connection, execution gates, workspace shell, and local-first deployment remain authoritative.

## Invariants every structural change must preserve

1. `discovery=ibkr` → IBKR-only prices, bars, depth, tape (no silent Alpaca fallback).
2. `auto_live` rejected; no live orders from maintenance work. All broker mutations go through `execution.service.execute` (ADR 007).
3. Quote / Level 2 / Time & Sales clear on symbol change; ignore stale WS instances.
4. Public HTTP/WS/local-storage contracts stay compatible unless a phase explicitly changes them.
